Five month ago I bought a 2017 Macbook Pro with the Touch Bar and have been using it for full time as daily computer. I will be talking about my opinion about the machine, what I like and dislike about it and some software that I used for my work environment.

To start off I come from a Windows background, but Windows was not able to perform up to par with what I needed it to do. There is also a lot of things that Windows does that made me move away from the OS. But that will be another post for another time.

When first getting the Mac, it frustrated me a lot as I was not familiar with the keybinds, or using the gestures on the trackpad. But over time I actually started enjoying using the trackpad. I also think the battery is very stellar and the screen is one of the most beautiful panel on a laptop that I have used.  What I really enjoy when using the Mac is the fact that itâ€™s a unix based system but also at the same time with a very solid ecosystem where updates never really breaks user space. There a decent amount of customizability when you start looking at different software and program to replace the default Mac applications. This was a pretty nice experience as I was able to customize my terminal, my shell, I was able to replace spotlight. It was also a very nice experience allowing me to learn how docker works, writing bash scripts and learning more about unix.

A few things that I did not find very pleasant with the Mac, was certain issues such as Packages being broken for a very long time ie Htop, Python Python 3.6 certificate issues, Apple being a very hard company to deal with in general when it comes to open source software. Other issues that I dislike are the fact that sometimes I get graphical glitches which forces me to restart my PC, random red bar which you have to reset the NVRAM, Another thing I dislike about the Macbook is the keyboard not a very big fan of it and also the lack of IO ports. When trying to run a VM it's typically very slow and unresponsive. When you have a USB C with ethernet connection and your mac goes to sleep you have to reconnect or unpredictable behaviours.

Overall, I as much as I enjoying using a Mac I think I will be switching a linux base system sometime in the near future. I think Linux base system will fit me much better and allow me to customizes as much as I want. I think the Macbook is to pricey for what it actually is, I bought one of the most expensive model as I wanted a 15 inch screen, 512gb of storage and 16gb of RAM. I think is very hard to justify the cost as you can build a powerful machine and run Linux with a nice Desktop environment(Maybe Deepin?) and it probably be just the same (ofc without the usual Apple flavour). But if you can justify the cost I think its a wonderful machine for many different people ranging from developer, video editor to just the casual users. I will still be using the Macbook but it will be my secondary computer for the meantime.

Application that I use:
Iterm2 - Terminal Replacement allows for more customizability
Alfred - A replacement of spotlight which allows allows for hotkeys, better searches and more customizable
Specticle - Allows for faster windows management
Dr Cleaner - Which allows me to have a fast indicator of ram usage and disk cleanup, etc
