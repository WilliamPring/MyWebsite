					<h2>Fun Fact #1</h2>
					<p>When I was younger, I was very interested in business. This passion of mine lead to me making small investments
						in the stock market. I had many good and bad investment mainly because I was still learning and trying to find
						which industry I would like to invest the most. I invested in companies such as Apple, Micosoft, Caterpillar and
						McDonolds. But, my successful investment was investing in Micosoft shares in 2011.

					<h2>Fun Fact #2</h2>
					<p>When I am not doing school work or side projects, I enjoy watching anime a lot for many different reason.
						I enjoy watching a different medium that is able to convey a emotional and brilliant story or scene with just drawings.
						My favorite genre for anime is Action, Fantasy, Adventure, and Mystery.
						My favorite anime are Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sword Art Online, Psycho-Pass and Stien Gate and Spirited Away.
						These are not order in any particular way.
