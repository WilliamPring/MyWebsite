  				<p>I am a second year Software Engineering Technology student in Conestoga
  					College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning. I have a lot of passion
  					in my chosen profession as I have many different side projects and have competed
  					in various programming competitions. I take pride in creating efficient and well designed program.
  					I consider myself to have a strong background in C++, C#, C and Data Structures. As much as I
  					enjoy programming I love talking and reading about project management, design patterns and design architectures.
  					I have a strong understanding of the SDLC, Agile/Waterfall Methodology and creating technical documents/diagram.

  					<h2>Fun Fact #1</h2>
  					<p>When I was younger, I was very interested in business. This passion of mine lead to me making small investments
  						in the stock market. I had many good and bad investment mainly because I was still learning and trying to find
  						which industry I would like to invest the most. I invested in companies such as Apple, Micosoft, Caterpillar and
  						McDonolds. But, my successful investment was investing in Micosoft shares in 2011.
